/// Provides a platform-independent way to access files and directories

///
/// Accessing files:
/// Every file and every directory must be accessed through the Filesystem.
/// Not a single C/C++ std file io call or other similar facilities
/// should be used in any other part of the engine in order to maintain
/// absolute platform independence.
///
/// Filesystem maintains a root path which acts as base directory for every
/// file operation; access to files outside the root path is not allowed. If
/// you really need it, instantiate another filesystem whith the appropriate
/// root path (e.g.)
///
/// Filesystem fs("/home/foo"); // fs will use "/home/foo" as root path
///
/// fs.is_file("bar.txt");      // file "bar.txt" is relative to the root path,
///                             // so it refers to "/home/foo/bar.txt"
///
/// The filesystem will take care of the necessary path conversions.
/// The root path must be an absolute path for the underlying operating system.
/// Examples of valid root paths:
///
/// 1) "/home/foo"
/// 2) "C:\Users\Phil"
///
/// The relative paths, used to access files, must follow some strict rules:
///
/// a) Only unix-like pathnames (i.e. case sensitive and using '/' as separator)
///    are allowed.
/// b) Only relative paths are allowed: the filesystem is responsible for
///    the creation of its absolute platform-specific counterpart.
/// c) Filesystem forbids pathnames containing '.' and '..' to prevent access to
///    files outside the filesystem's root path.
/// d) Platform specific characters like '/', '\\' and ':' are forbidden as well.
/// e) Symlinks, on platforms which support them, are _not_ resolved for the same
///    reason of c)
/// f) Although mixed-case pathnames are allowed, it is generally safer to use
///    only lower-case ones for maximum compatibility.
///
/// Examples of valid relative paths.
///
/// 1) data/textures/grass.texture
/// 2) grass.texture
/// 3) foo/bar
